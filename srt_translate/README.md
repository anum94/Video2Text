## Usage
```
cd srt_translate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing the necessary dependencies, you can run the script using:

```bash
python translate_srt.py path/to/your/file.srt
```

Make sure to replace `path/to/your/file.srt` with the actual path to your subtitle file.

## Configuration

Before running the script, you need to set up your OpenAI API key. You can do this by setting an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` or by placing it in a file named `api_token.txt` in the same directory as the script.
